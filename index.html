      <p>The Ronald McDonald House provides overnight housing for families whose children are undergoing medical procedures at the local medical center. For many years, room reservations for these families were made using a paper-based calendar system, which was cumbersome and labor intensive. </p>

<p>In 2011, a 2-student team at Bowdoin College developed an on-line room scheduling system to replace this paper-based process. This new system allows the non-profit to plan, predict, and report on room utilization more easily, benefiting both the organization's volunteer team and the clients that rely on the House's services.  Homeroom was upgraded and refined by a 4-student team in Fall 2013.</p>

<p>In addition to the Homeroom code base, the design document, sandbox database, and weekly assignments from the Fall 2013 class can be downloaded from <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B89idqv1KuSVbVBpTG1xcXUwdFU&amp;usp=sharing">here</a></p>
